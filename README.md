## About the Book

Flexible in approach and full of colorful examples, this textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to art for individuals who may not identify as "artists." It explores a variety of art themes, genres, materials, and processes, with lessons organized by themes of general subject matter or media. 

Readers can work with traditional media such as drawing and painting or experiment with mixed media, photography, crafts, and digital media. Each thematic unit offers progressive lessons designed to develop a deeper understanding of art concepts, techniques, and processes.
